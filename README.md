# 🚀 IT-Service

A platform dedicated to companies to optimize IT request management and reduce the workload of IT specialists. With this solution, employees can submit their issues as tickets via the platform without needing to contact an IT specialist directly.
A planner reviews each ticket and assigns it to the appropriate IT specialist for resolution. Throughout the process, both the planner and the employee receive updates on the ticket status, either via email or through the integrated notification system.
Additionally, IT-Service offers a knowledge base containing videos and articles to help employees resolve common issues without creating a ticket or contacting an IT specialist.
The platform also manages hardware and software requests, providing a structured process for these needs.
